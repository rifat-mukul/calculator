# Calculator Project

This project is a simple and interactive calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, and more. The calculator features a clean and modern design and is fully responsive for a smooth user experience.

## Project Overview

The calculator consists of three main components:
1. **HTML** - Structure of the calculator and buttons.
2. **CSS** - Styles to create the design, responsiveness, and animations.
3. **JavaScript** - The logic behind the operations, including the calculations and button interactions.

### Key Features:
- **AC (All Clear)** - Clears the current input field.
- **DEL (Delete)** - Removes the last entered digit.
- **Basic Operations** - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Percentage** - Performs percentage calculation.
- **Equal Button** - Computes the result of the operation.
- **Decimal Point** - Allows entering decimal numbers.

## How to Use

### Requirements:
- A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.)
- No installation is needed. Just open the HTML file in your browser.

### Steps:
1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
2. The calculator interface will appear on the screen.
3. Click on the numeric buttons (0-9) to enter numbers.
4. Use the operator buttons (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`) to perform calculations.
5. Click on the **AC** button to clear the input or **DEL** to delete the last entry.
6. Click the **=** button to compute the result.
7. Use the **.`** button for entering decimal numbers.

### Example:
1. Press `7`, `+`, `5`, and then press `=`.
2. The result displayed will be `12`.

### Button Breakdown:
- **Numeric Buttons**: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 00
- **Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- **AC (All Clear)**: Clears the input field.
